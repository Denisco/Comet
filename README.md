# Comet
Comet is a managed version of Disk Cleanup developed in C#.
Its purpose is to help out those who would like to automate specific cleanup related tasks.
It also serves as a peek into the world of backwards compatibility, given the fact that the Disk Cleanup API has barely changed since its introduction in 1997.

# Working with COM
This project is among the first few where I've worked with COM, thus some implementation may not be exactly ideal. Feedback is greatly appreciated.
